    <h1>I am kind of a dumbass</h1>
    <p>So, when I began this website 20 hours ago, I decided that I would make it in the style of websites that... don't really appeal to the modern UI designer.</p>
    <p>I personally think the design looks fine, maybe even pretty, I like how the design feels like a book, which makes it nicer to read.</p>
    <p>But that doesn't remove the fact that this website isn't super well designed. I talked to [bano], a friend from discord about how to change the design of this website for
        the better, and they recommended me a few ideas, but one of the main things that they disagreed with me on were the little article boxes on the main page.
    </p>
    <div class="box">
        <h2> For example... </h2>
        <div class="ar">
            <h3> Wow, I am an article </h3>
            <img src="../article1.png" href="articles/thefirstarticle.html">
            <p>20/12/2023<br>"Why am I lower than you?"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ar">
            <h3> Me too! </h3>
            <img src="../article1.png" href="articles/thefirstarticle.html">
            <p>20/12/2064<br>"Hell yeah!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>...in any case, I am clearly not a Frontend Engineer, I wouldn't even call myself anything really, since I don't really get paid to do anything.</p>
    <p>I like the sort of "thumbnail" design these little boxes have. I know that maybe it isn't the best, but if you go to any modern news site,</p>
    <img src="../artimages/news site.png" height="400px" width="400px" class="image">
    <p>you can see that their modern design resembles that of something like the Youtube homepage. I know that this isn't the best way to do this, but in my opinion
        this design makes it so that the user can just click on the latest article and start reading.
    </p>
    <p>This might get obsolete 2 days later when I realise that this was a terrible idea and I go back to not using this kind of format, 
        but for now, while it is obviously not the best design at all,
    </p>
    <p>I do think the design <i>works</i>.</p>
