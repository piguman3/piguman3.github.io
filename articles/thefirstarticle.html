    <h1>The first article on this thing</h1>

    <p>So, I should probably explain the existance of this site, shouldn't I?</p>
    <p>A while back I discovered <a href="https://mitxela.com/">mitxela.com</a>, the amazing blog about plotting, printers and really tiny LED earrings,
        and the also amazing <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com</a>, a sequel to 
        <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a>, now with 7 declarations of CSS.</p>
    <p>When I looked at these sites, especially the second, I thought to myself, "What if I made my own website?"</p>
    <p>I know some amount of HTML and the such, it isn't super hard to make a github pages site, and I can always learn from other websites to make one, so... Why not?</p>
    <p>This website is essentially just a bunch of assets from different websites thrown together in a blender. The CSS for the <code>body</code> of the website was taken
    from bettermotherfuckingwebsite, the styling for the articles' <code>div</code> was done the same as mitxela.</p>
    <p>Anything that isn't just stolen from other websites was done by just reading some tutorials on W3Schools, such as the <code>"code styling"</code>.</p>
    <p>You can compare my website to theirs here:</p>

    <div class="box">
        <div class="bx">
            <embed style="border:none;" src="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com" width="425px" height="525px">
            <br>
        </div>

        <div class="bx">
            <embed style="border:none;" src="https://mitxela.com/hardware" width="425px" height="525px">
            <br>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>(Thanks afonya for walking through <code>embed</code> hell with me)</p>
    
    <p>I could talk about how the Internet allows this kind of "stealing", how it is both a blessing and a curse, but this is the first article, so I'll leave it here for now.</p>
